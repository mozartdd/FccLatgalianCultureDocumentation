                    <p>Latgalians (Latin: Lethi, Letthigalli, Low German: Letti, Lethi, modern Latvian: latgaļi, letgaļi, leti; 
                        variant translations also include Latgallians, Lettigalls or Lettigallians) were an ancient Baltic tribe.
                        They likely spoke a variant of Latvian language, which probably became the lingua franca in present-day Latvia 
                        during the Northern Crusades due to their alliance with the crusaders. 
                        Latgalians later assimilated into the neighbouring tribes, forming the core of modern Latvians.</p>

                    <p>In the Latgalian language, the terms latgalīši and latgaļi have been traditionally used as synonyms describing both 
                        ancient and contemporary Latgalians as a part of the same continuum. The term latgalīši (in both meanings) prevailed 
                        in Latgalian literature and mass media during the first decades of the 20th century, whereas the term latgali has been 
                        consistently used (also in both meanings) in Latgalian literature and media published during the 1920s and 1930s in Latvia 
                        and from 1940 to 1988 in exile. Since the cultural revival of Latgalians in 1988, there is a tendency in 
                        Latgalian literature and media to follow Latvians in their use of both names.</p>

                    <p>In the lands inhabited by Western and the Eastern Latgalians, about 80 flat cemeteries of Western 
                        Latgalian origin have been excavated, with more than two thousand burials uncovered.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><p>The first large scale excavations took place in Ludza Odukalns Cemetery in Latgale (1890–1891), where 339 Late Iron Age burials were uncovered.</p></li>
                        <li><p>In the excavations at Pildas Nukši Cemetery (in Latgale, 1947–1948), 218 burials were uncovered, dated to the 9th to 12th centuries.</p></li>
                        <li><p>At the Zvirgzdenes Kivti Cemetery (in Latgale: 1948, 1955–1958), 175 burials from the 7th to 12th centuries were excavated.</p></li>
                        <li><p>315 burials were found at Aglonas Kristapiņi Cemetery (in Latgale; 1928, 1938, 1977–1980, 1984–1987, 1999–2000), in use from the late 8th century to the 12th century.</p></li>
                        <li><p>Ērgļu Jaunāķēni Cemetery was totally excavated in 1971–1972, with 89 burials found.</p></li>
                        <li><p>At Koknese Cemetery, 102 burials from the Late Iron Age were uncovered (1986–1989).</p></li>
                        <li><p>In the area of the Gauja river, two Latgalian cemeteries, Drabešu Liepiņas and Priekuļu Ģūģeri, have been excavated too.</p></li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>In Latgale, dating from the 6th and 7th centuries, there were flat cemeteries as well as barrow cemeteries. In the 9th and 10th centuries,
                         the transition started from flat graves to barrows. There are about 15 excavated Eastern Latgalian barrow cemeteries, 
                         but in most of them only a small number of barrows were investigated.</p>
                    <p>It is possible that ancestors of the so-called Eastern Latgalians migrated to the territory of present-day Latgale between the 7th and 11th 
                        centuries, pushed from their previously inhabited territory by Slavic migrations; some archaeologists also believe that the Eastern Latgalians 
                        are descended from the more ancient East-Baltic inhabitants of Latvia, who lived in central and eastern Latvia during the "Roman" Iron Age (1st to 4th centuries).</p>

                    <p>Modern Latgalians developed as a result of Latgale having developed separately from other parts of contemporary Latvia after it was divided between Sweden 
                        and Poland after 1621 Truce of Altmark, leaving the most eastern part of Latvia under Polish control as Inflanty Voivodeship. This resulted in the 
                        Roman Catholic church becoming the main religious denomination in Latgale (while the rest of Latvia is traditionally Lutheran). The local dialects of 
                        Latvian language underwent a sound change probably due to Slavic influence, resulting in another feature distinguishing Latgalians from rest of 
                        Latvians. After the first Partition of Poland in 1772, Inflanty was incorporated in the Russian Empire. In 1865, as part of Russia's anti-Polish 
                        policies, a period of Russification was begun, during which the Latgalian language (written in Latin script) was forbidden. 
                        This ban was lifted in 1904, and a period of Latgalian reawakening began.</p>

                    <p>During the first independence of Latvia (1918–1940), Latgale was the only region of Latvia with strong regional political parties. 
                        Although Latvian governments mainly promoted a united Latvian culture, fostering assimilation of Latgalians, especially after the coup by Kārlis Ulmanis in 
                        1934, the Latgalian language was also used. Books were published in Latgalian, it was taught in some schools, and people could choose to use Latgalian 
                        when communicating with the government. They were classified as a Narodnosti in the First All Union Census of the Soviet Union in 1926. In the Nazi 
                        German Generalplan Ost, as far as can be told from the surviving documentation, the Latgalians were scheduled
                         for deportation, while only half of the Latvian population was to be treated so. The reasons for this difference are unclear, 
                        but possibly based on racist linguistic arguments, considering that the Nazis planned to physically remove 85% of the Lithuanians 
                        (whose language – and by erroneous inference ethnicity – has similarities to Latgalian).</p>

                    <p>Latgalians continued to publish books and periodicals abroad. Publishing in Latgalian in Latvia resumed during the Third National 
                        Awakening in the late 1980s but is still rare (e.g. the internet culture magazine Lakuga.lv). The Latgalian language is mostly used at 
                        home in rural areas and Latvian is overwhelmingly used in official use and in urban areas. Some government protection for the 
                        Latgalian language is provided by the language law of 2000 which states that "the State shall ensure the maintenance, 
                        protection and development of the Latgalian written language as a historic variant of the Latvian language."[5]</p>
                    <p>Some Latgalians consider themselves to be an ethnic group separate from Latvians. The majority and historical opinion is, 
                        however, that present-day Latgalians are a subgroup of the Latvians who are united by a 
                        dialect, which has many regional varieties. The number of people who would identify themselves as separate from Latvians 
                        is unknown because the Latvian government does not identify Latgalians as a separate group in census data.</p>
                    <p>The 2011 Census of Latvia established that 8.8% of Latvia's inhabitants[6][7] or 164,500 people speak Latgalian daily. 
                        97,600 of them live in Latgale, 29,400 in Riga, and 14,400 in Riga region.</p>

                        Latgalian is a Baltic language or dialect spoken in the Latgale region of eastern Latvia. It is closely related to Latvian
                         but is considered by some linguists and native speakers as a distinct language due to differences in vocabulary, grammar, and pronunciation. However, others consider it a dialect of Latvian.</p>

                    <p>The Latgalian tribes were one of the main ethnic groups in the early medieval period in the Baltic region, known for their distinct culture, language, and identity within the wider Latvian
                         and Lithuanian tribes. Over time, Latgale became a part of the Livonian Confederation, and later, various political powers such as Poland and Russia 
                         influenced the region, leading to shifts in culture and language. Modern Latgalians, while still preserving unique aspects of their heritage, face challenges 
                         with the survival of their language, Latgalian, which has been overshadowed by standard Latvian in recent decades. However, there is a growing movement to revive 
                         and maintain Latgalian language and culture, emphasizing its importance in the identity of the Latgale region.</p>
